# OpenFisca Canada  

## Writing the Legislation

This is an experiment. We're coding pieces of Canada's legislation, regulation, and some government policy into rules that run in the Open Fisca calculation engine. We've released all the code here, for anyone to use.


## Install Instructions for Users and Contributors

This package requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) .

## Installing this Country Package (Canada)

Supported platforms:
- GNU/Linux distributions (in particular Debian and Ubuntu);
- Mac OS X;
- Microsoft Windows (we recommend using [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) instead of the default console).

Other OS should work if they can execute Python and NumPy.

Pick option (A) or (B)


### Installation

Follow this installation if you wish to:
  - run calculations on a large population;
  - run your own instance of OpenFisca-canada
  - run your own instance of the OpenFisca-canada rules package, as an OpenFisca Web API.
  - modify the rules

We are recommending you use docker:
  * [Run in docker](SETUP-docker.md) to run on an instance or your laptop
